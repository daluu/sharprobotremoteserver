# Overview #

**NOTE:** you might want to check out an improved fork of this project at: http://code.google.com/p/nrobotremote. Consider this original to be obsolete and superseded by the fork. However, this version may be useful in case you prefer the architectural design of the original than the fork.

This project offers a generic remote server for [Robot Framework](http://www.robotframework.org), implemented in .NET, for use in creating remote libraries. It can alternatively be used for other purposes outside of [Robot Framework](http://www.robotframework.org). Remote server requires the [XML-RPC.NET](http://www.xml-rpc.net) library for .NET.

Please read RemoteServerDetails page for installation, usage, and details about the remote library server.

Also see SharpRobotRemoteServerIdeas for some ideas on what we could do with this server.
